# Library Manager - Consid Code Test

## Development environment
- Windows 10, version 2004
- Visual Studio Enterprise 2019, version 16.9.2. 
- .NET 5, ASP.NET MVC
- Entity Framework with an MSSQL Database

## Run instructions
To run the solution, import the solution to Visual Studio and open the solution. Then, let the packages download, 
and run the package manager console, run the "update-database" command. A local SQL db should be generated and 
seeded with some test-data. And you're good to go!

## Assignment
Scenario 1 has been completed in this assignment, and all of the acceptance criteria has been met.
Due to some time constraints due to my bachelors thesis, I only implemented scenario 1, as only one was 
obligatory, and I focused on making it as good as I could. And the scenarios tests roughly the same stuff
anyway ;)

## Unit tests
I unit tested some methods in part to verify their intended functionality (of course), and also as a demonstration 
that I am familiar with unit testing as a concept, and that I can implement it to a project. However, due to the 
afromentioned schoolwork, I had to limit the ammount of tests to keep the focus on implementing the best actual
solution to satisy the assignments acceptance criteria.
