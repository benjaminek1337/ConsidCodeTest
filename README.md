# Library Manager - Consid Code Test

## Development environment
- Windows 10, version 2004
- Visual Studio Enterprise 2019, version 16.9.2. 
- .NET 5, ASP.NET MVC
- Entity Framework with an MSSQL Database

## Run instructions
To run the solution, import the solution to Visual Studio and open the solution. Then, let the packages download, and run the package manager console, run the "update-database" command. A local SQL db should be generated and seeded with some test-data. And you're good to go!

## Assignment
Scenario 1 has been completed in this assignment, and all of the acceptance criteria has been met.
Due to some time constraints due to my bachelors thesis, I only implemented scenario 1, as only one was 
obligatory, and I focused on making it as good as I could. And the scenarios test roughly the same stuff
anyway ;)

## Unit tests
I unit tested some of the more troublesome methods to verify intended functionality, and that I am familiar
with unit testing as a concept, and can implement it to a project. However, due to the afromentioned 
schoolwork, I had to limit the ammount of tests.
